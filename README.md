# D603-Task-1-Classification-Data-Mining-Models
### Overview
This project focuses on predicting 30-day patient readmission using a Random Forest classification model, leveraging demographic, medical, and hospitalization data.

### Random Forest Classification â€“ Patient Readmission Prediction
-	Developed and optimized a Random Forest model to predict 30-day patient readmission using demographic, medical, and hospitalization data (~20 features).
-	Performed hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV) to optimize accuracy, achieving ~98% accuracy, precision, and recall; identified key risk factors like hospital stay duration and total charges.
-	Evaluated model performance using AUC-ROC, confusion matrix, and feature importance analysis to guide hospital interventions.
