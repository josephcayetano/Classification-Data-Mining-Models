# Classification Data Mining Models
### Overview
This project used a Random Forest model to predict whether a patient would be readmitted within 30 days, based on their demographic, medical, and hospital data.

### Random Forest Classification â€“ Patient Readmission Prediction
-	Built and improved a Random Forest model using about 20 features, including patient history and hospital stay details
-	Tuned the model with GridSearchCV and achieved around 98% accuracy, precision, and recall
-	Identified key factors like length of stay and total charges; evaluated the model using AUC-ROC, confusion matrix, and feature importance to support hospital decisions
